# Topology

This lab is basically the same as the [06_from_kind_with_pods](../06_from_kind_with_pods) with the exception
that instead of leveraging a physical interface to talk to the leaf router, the node leverages a vlan interface.

This is to demonstrate the case where we don't want to move a whole interface in the namespace for the
bgp session.

All the rest is the same as the other lab.
